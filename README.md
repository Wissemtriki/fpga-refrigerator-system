# FPGA Refrigerator System

This project is an embedded systems design implemented using **Quartus II** and **FPGA technology**.  
It simulates and manages various use cases of a smart refrigerator, including:

- **Presence Detection Project** – detects user presence and triggers system responses.  
- **Global Lighting System Project** – controls interior and exterior lighting behavior.  
- **State Machine Lighting Project** – manages operational states using FSM design.  
- **Luminosity Measurement Project** – measures and adjusts lighting based on brightness levels.

### Tools Used
- Intel Quartus II
- FPGA Development Board

### Objective
Demonstrate how digital logic design and hardware description techniques can control appliance behavior efficiently and in real time.
